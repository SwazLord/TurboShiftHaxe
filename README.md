# 🚗 Turbo Shift – Haxe + OpenFL Edition

This is the Haxe/OpenFL port of the *Turbo Shift* racing game, originally developed using ActionScript 3 and Starling. The AS3 codebase was converted to Haxe using **AS3HX**, a tool developed by the OpenFL team to assist with code migration.

## 🔄 AS3 to Haxe Conversion

- The conversion was done using **AS3HX**, which translates AS3 syntax to Haxe.
- The game logic, structure, and visuals remain mostly unchanged.
- Manual tweaking was applied where necessary to ensure compatibility with OpenFL.

## 🎮 Features

- Converted from AS3 using **AS3HX**
- Built with **OpenFL**, a Haxe-based framework for Flash-style APIs
- Maintains the core look and feel of the original AS3 + Starling version
- Deployable to **HTML5** only

- **Haxe** (programming language)
- **OpenFL** (Flash-like API for modern platforms)
- **AS3HX** (AS3 to Haxe conversion tool)
